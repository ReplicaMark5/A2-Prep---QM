            - 30 marks (Reliability) → _calculations_
                
            - 10 marks → _theory_
                
- **3 questions**  
    (2 with subquestions → total 2 or 3 questions)
    
- **Tip:**  
    If you can do 3 quizzes + 3 examples in lecture notes + tutorials on the sides, then you’re good.

### Reliability Section

- Reliability block diagram — _not that difficult_
    
- **Quiz 3 (F1 car example)** similar to exam format:

### MODELS

**What cannot be asked (normal exam without computers):**

- Parameter estimation
    
- Long-term cost estimation
    
- Confidence intervals
    
- Weibull residual life _(not sure if confirmed)_
    

Everything that can be calculated **by hand with formulas** _can and will be asked._

### Calculations

A mix of:

- Reliability
    
- Component importance
    
- Availability
