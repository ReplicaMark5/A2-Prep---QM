## Imke's Work

Quality Management (≈60%)
Content: [[Weeks]]

### Six Sigma (DMAIC & DFSS)
- **DMAIC:** Define → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Control.  
- **DFSS (DMADV):** Define → Measure → Analyze → Design → Verify.  
- DFSS is for *new process or product design*; DMAIC for *improving existing ones*.  
- Key roles: Leadership, Champion, Master BB, BB, GB — each with training & accountability.  
- Focus on purpose, structure, and linkage to organizational performance.

### Root Cause Analysis (RCCA)
- Juran’s four-step method: **Define → Analyze → Improve → Control.**  
- Purpose: detect deviation, find root cause, implement corrective action, maintain control.  
- Tools to know: 5 Whys, Fishbone, Pareto, FMEA, Histogram, Scatter, Stratification.  
- **Awareness only**, no numeric or deep statistics required.

### Design of Experiments (DoE)
- Theory-based only.  
- Understand *why* DoE is used and how it differs from one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT).  
- Emphasize: efficiency, interactions, randomization, blocking.  
- Know terminology: **factor, level, treatment, interaction, response variable.**

### Strategic Planning & Deployment
- Understand benefits of strategic quality planning.  
- Key links: mission → goals → deployment → measurement → improvement.  
- *Deployment of Goals* = end of scope.  
- Align with Six Sigma structure and roles.

### Final Tutorial / Integration
- Covers **all 10 weeks**.  
- Expect synthesis question linking DMAIC, RCCA, planning, and roles.  
- “Develop a quality management implementation plan” theme.  
- Integration and application are key.

## Study Priorities (Recommended Focus)

1. Work through **tutorials, lecture examples, and quizzes**.  
2. Revisit **Survival Kits** or end-of-chapter summaries.  
3. Review **slides** for definitions and frameworks.  
4. Emphasize **conceptual understanding** and **application integration**.  
5. Skip advanced derivations or software specifics.
