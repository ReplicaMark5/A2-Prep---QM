## Imke's Work

Quality Management (≈60%)
Detailed chapter breakdown: see [[Weeks]] for full scope and sources.

> [!todo] **Quality Management – Exam Focus**
>
> **Six Sigma and Continuous Innovation (DMAIC + DFSS/DMADV)**
> • **DMAIC (Ch. 15):** Define → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Control — for improving existing processes
> • **DFSS/DMADV (Ch. 17):** Define → Measure → Analyze → Design → Verify — for new process/product design
> • Scope: Up to before "Evolution of Design and Innovation Methods" (see Week 7/8)
> • Focus: purpose, five DMADV stages, difference from DMAIC
> • **No reliability calculations** — theory only
> • Key roles: Leadership, Champion, Master BB, BB, GB
> • Action: Understand organizational linkage and role accountability
>
> **Root Cause Analysis (RCCA) — Ch. 16**
> • Juran's four-step method: Define → Analyze → Improve → Control
> • Tools to know: 5 Whys, Fishbone, Pareto, FMEA, Histogram, Scatter, Stratification
> • Focus: **Awareness only** — no numeric or deep statistics required
> • Action: Know purpose of each tool
>
> **Quality Planning & Control — Ch. 4, 6**
> • Ch. 4: Up to before "Juran Quality by Design Model sub-steps"
> • Ch. 6: Up to before "Pyramid of Control"
> • Focus: Control charts, process capability, corrective actions
> • Action: Exam-relevant chapters — review thoroughly
>
> **Strategic Planning & Performance Excellence — Ch. 7, 8**
> • Benefits of strategic quality planning
> • Key links: mission → goals → deployment → measurement → improvement
> • Scope: Up to *Deployment of Goals* (exclude Hoshin Kanri)
> • Ch. 8: Leadership, quality teams, manager roles — links to Six Sigma roles
> • Action: See Week 8 materials
>
> **Inspection, Test & Measurement — Ch. 24**
> • Focus: Sampling inspection, accuracy, measurement errors
> • Action: Reinforces control and verification (see Week 9)

> [!warning] **HIGH EXAM PROBABILITY**
> **Accurate & Reliable Data (DoE) — §20.7.7**
> • **Theory only:** purpose, use, importance — no numerical work
> • Understand why DoE is used vs. one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT)
> • Key concepts: efficiency, interactions, randomization, blocking
> • Terminology: factor, level, treatment, interaction, response variable
> • Action: Review Week 10 materials thoroughly

### Final Tutorial / Integration
- Covers **all 10 weeks**.
- Expect synthesis question linking DMAIC, RCCA, planning, and roles.
- "Develop a quality management implementation plan" theme.
- Integration and application are key.

## Study Priorities (Recommended Focus)

1. Work through **tutorials, lecture examples, and quizzes**.  
2. Revisit **Survival Kits** or end-of-chapter summaries.  
3. Review **slides** for definitions and frameworks.  
4. Emphasize **conceptual understanding** and **application integration**.  
5. Skip advanced derivations or software specifics.

|:--|:--|:--|
| Theory | Short definition or purpose question | 8–10 |
| Application | Scenario-based or integration plan | 10–15 |
| Numerical | Reliability formulas and diagram calculations | 25–30 |
| **Total** | | **≈40 marks** |
