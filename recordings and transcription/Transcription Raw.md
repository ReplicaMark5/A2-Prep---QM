Well, there's only two. For which model can't you get the residual life? The next expected failure. No, wrong model. Okay, Weibull. So Weibull, next expected failure. You also need the lookup of the integrals. What else? One last thing. 
S
Speaker 2
00:59
Come on. 
S
Speaker 1
01:02
Uncertainty. There's a hint. Uncertainty. Confidence intervals, upper and lower confidence intervals. All the rest you can calculate analytically with the formulas that will be provided to you. Okay, so I have to give you parameter values. I can't ask you long term cost optimization. I can't ask you the confidence limits. Okay? But when it comes to calculating reliability, calculating the hazard rate, calculating next expected failures or brackets for repairable systems, non homogeneous poison process, you can calculate all of that with the formulas that are given to you analytically. Okay? 40 marks. A2, 10 marks, Theory. 30 marks, 
S
Speaker 1
01:58
Calculations. Calculations will be a mix of what you did. Reliability calculations, component importance, availability. Any of those things you can calculate. Okay, so there's three questions. And two of the questions have got two or three sub questions all in all, 30 marks. If you go through the tutorials, the examples in the lecture notes, the three quizzes, you should be able to ace it. Okay. And there is a strong possibility that there will be a reliability block diagram in there. Okay. But won't be that difficult. So think of Quiz 3 where you've got the Formula 1, the F1 car, where I actually give you a reliability block diagram. Or ask you give you a scenario of the reliability block diagram. 
S
Speaker 1
03:11
And also giving you the parameters for the different components in that block diagram, you can expect something similar to that. A3, which hopefully we don't see any of you in. Same distribution, 40 marks, Reliability engineering. 
S
Speaker 1
03:33
In A3 there's 15 marks worth of theory and 25 marks worth of calculation. Also covering the same analytical stuff that you could find in A2. But as I say, if you work through the material that we've gone through that's available during the semester, quizzes, examples, all of that, I mean I'm not going to try and give you a pink canary, of some sort that's gonna be a stumbling block. Okay, Any questions? Thank you. Then that's over and out from me. Thanks for your engagement in class during the reliability engineering part and good luck with your exams and we'll see you at graduation. 




Speaker 2
04:35
Okay, so the following document, it's already up on Sunlearn. Stemlearn. It's just hidden so you don't have to write this down, right? The document will be made available to you. So what I've done. It might be small on here, but like I said, you have everything for every week I outlined. Whether it's just the textbook, never just the textbook, whether it's just the slides or the slides and the textbook. Right. Typically if we do that, it's because it's too summarized in the slide and you need more information worth of examples, those kinds of things. Right. So week one, just the slides, more than enough. Well, week one of my work things. Then chapter five, 15, 16, chapter five, only the slides, more than enough. Chapter 15, textbook and slides. And then also important, chapter 16. Right. We didn't do chapter 16. 
S
Speaker 2
05:38
But you need to be aware of all of those different tools and techniques. Right. Chapter four, textbook and slides. When I clearly outline exactly up to which point in the textbook. Right. And same for chapter 17, same for chapter 6 and then chapter 7 in textbook I'm outlining exactly up to which point in the textbook as well as the slides. Chapter 8 on the organizational role. The slides are more than enough, already summarized in the slides. Chapter 24, same thing. Slides more than enough. And then chapter 20 slides as well as the textbook. But it's just the one section, right? It's just 2.7.7. So just the DOE bit. I'm not going to ask you to calculate something like if there's a DOE question, it's on theory. How do we use it, why it's important, what do we do with it? 
S
Speaker 2
06:43
All of the things clearly highlighted. Also in the slide I mentioned this at the start of the module or my part of the module. Make sure you already have. If you haven't done it already. Make sure you download the textbook in advance. The sections that you need. If you do it right before A2 or A3, there might be too many people on the system and the system gets overloaded. Speaker 1 mentioned this. It's about a 60, 40 split. Right. So in A1 was more geared towards Speaker 1s work. A2 and A3, the split is based on how we the split of the work across the module. 
S
Speaker 2
07:20
Right. So 60% my work, 40% Speaker 1s work. The type of questions in my work. So it ranges from lowest number of marks is 8 marks up to 15 marks. 
S
Speaker 1
07:35
Right. 
S
Speaker 2
07:35
So medium sized questions, there's no really short ones and there's no extensively long ones. And the types of questions same as what speaker 1 mentioned. There's kind of a theory bit. We want to see that you understand the scientific foundations behind the thinking and then also application. Right. What are the key areas that I should consider that if you were in a position where you manage the quality in the company, how would you go about doing this? Okay, so similar also to the tutorials, the combination between theory and then applying that, right? In an example or a case, some questions would just ask you to, okay, now tell us how you would do this or we give you a brief case, right? In this scenario, how would you use it? Okay. 
S
Speaker 2
08:26
And any questions on this, you're more than welcome to also send us an email if you have any additional questions. So the last tutorial for this module, it is nothing but revision of everything, right? So all of the 10 weeks, you have to go through those concepts, right? And then ultimately consider that in the context of the organization that you had prioritizing, what would you suggest that they do, right? Which of these concepts should they implement and where should they use it? And then ultimately develop kind of a quality management implementation plan for them. So how would you suggest they go about it? The key thing is to consider all of these concepts, right? Make sure also you don't have any questions, right? Going into the exam, at least take this time, think about each of those concepts as you go through the tutorial. 
S
Speaker 2
09:44
You still have time if you get you one of those concepts and you're like, listen, there's something I don't understand. That's also the kind of idea behind this tutorial, both in terms of speaker 1's work as well as myself. So that you can ask still, right? So that you are forced to engage with the work before the end of the term, right? Okay. This is also already up on STEM Learn. STEM Learn. And I still don't use the correct word. And then next week, Wednesday, please submit, okay? If there's any questions, please feel free to also come ask the groups at 1120. Please remember to fill this up. Make a copy, do take a copy.
