## Key Exam Themes

### Theory vs Application Balance
- Most topics require both **conceptual understanding** and **scenario application**
- Speaker 2 emphasis: "understand foundations AND how you would apply it"

### Tool Knowledge Focus
- Know **purpose and when to use**, not detailed calculations
- Exception: Some tools may require basic application understanding

### Scope Boundaries
- Textbook extents clearly marked for each topic
- Stay within specified boundaries to focus revision

### Cross-References
- Six Sigma roles link to organizational structure (Lecture 16, Chapter 8)
- DMAIC vs DMADV comparison (Lectures 12, Chapter 17)
- Strategic deployment connects to quality planning (Lecture 15, 16)
