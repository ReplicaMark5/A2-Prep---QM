**Chapter 17 – Continuous Innovation / DFSS**

---
> DFSS / DMADV → new process
> DMAIC → existing process

> [!summary] Purpose  
> Continuous Innovation (CI) = **systematic creation of new products, services, or processes** that meet hidden or emerging customer needs.  
> It relies on **Design for Six Sigma (DFSS)**, executed through the **DMADV** method: Define → Measure → Analyze → Design → Verify.

## 1  Continuous Innovation and the Juran Trilogy

> [!example] Juran's Trilogy — Revision
>
> Revision from [[Lecture 9#🔺 Juran's Trilogy (The Core Framework)]] and [[Chapter 4#1. Where This Fits in the Juran Trilogy]]
>
> Juran taught that quality improvement and innovation both start with *planning for customer needs*.
>
> - CI extends the Juran Trilogy (planning, control, improvement) by focusing on **innovation as planned quality**.
> - Innovation happens when hidden customer needs are **discovered** and solved systematically — not by accident.
> - This makes DFSS a **structured innovation engine**, not a random brainstorming exercise.
>
> **Key Insight:**
> Continuous improvement fixes what exists.
> Continuous innovation **creates what doesn't exist yet**.

## 2  Design for Six Sigma (DFSS)

**Definition:**  
DFSS is a **systematic approach to designing new or redesigned goods, services, or processes** that achieve Six Sigma-level quality performance.

**Goal:**  
- Build quality and reliability **into design**, not into inspection later.  
- Achieve both *the right features* and *the fewest failures*.

**Philosophy:**  
Plan quality from the start → capture customer needs → convert them into <span style="color:rgb(196, 51, 2)">measurable design requirements (CTQs)</span> → verify before launch.

**Scope:**  
- Used in **new product introduction (NPI)**, service design, or process redesign.  
- Works for **goods, services, and transactional processes** alike.

> [!learn] LEARN THIS  
> DFSS ≠ DMAIC.  
> DMAIC improves *existing* systems.  
> DFSS *creates* or *redesigns* systems to meet new needs.

## 3  DMADV – The DFSS Implementation Method

> [!bug] EXAM CRITICAL — DMADV Steps
> Know the 5 DMADV phases and difference from DMAIC
> Textbook extent: Up to before "Evolution of Design and Innovation Methods"
^exam-critical-dmadv

> [!important]
> **DMADV = the roadmap used to implement DFSS.**
> DFSS is the *methodology*; DMADV is the *step-by-step process* that executes it.

| **Phase**              | **Purpose**                                                 | **Typical Activities / Deliverables**                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Select (pre-phase)** | Identify new market opportunities aligned with strategy.    | Evaluate ROI, select projects, form team, define charter.                                             |
| **Define**             | Clarify business case, goals, and customers.                | Draft charter, establish scope, identify stakeholders, confirm need for a *new* design.               |
| **Measure**            | Discover and quantify customer needs (VOC → CTQs).          | Customer segmentation, QFD matrices, FMEA, baseline scorecard.                                        |
| **Analyze**            | Develop and evaluate high-level design alternatives.        | Functional analysis, simulations, TRIZ, risk and capability analysis.                                 |
| **Design**             | Create detailed, optimized product/service/process design.  | DOE, modeling, tolerance setting, pilot prototypes.                                                   |
| **Verify**             | Confirm performance and readiness for full-scale operation. | Pilot testing, verification of manufacturing/service capability, control plans, transition to owners. |

> [!info] **QFD – Quality Function Deployment**  
> A **systematic method** for deploying *customer needs* into **every stage of design and production.**  
>  
> Think of it as a **bridge** between marketing language (“I want it faster”) and engineering language (“reduce cycle time by 25%”).  
>  
> QFD ensures that the **customer’s voice drives the design** — not the other way around.

## 4  DFSS vs DMAIC – Core Distinctions

> [!example] DMAIC — Revision
>
> DMAIC introduced in [[Lecture 12#4. The DMAIC Logic — Step by Step Understanding]]
>
> | **Aspect** | **DMAIC (Improve Existing)** | **DFSS / DMADV (Design New)** |
> |-------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
> | **Trigger** | Performance gap or defect | New opportunity or unmet need |
> | **Objective** | Fix root cause, stabilize process | Create design that meets CTQs from the start |
> | **Outcome** | Incremental improvement | Breakthrough innovation |
> | **Phases** | Define – Measure – Analyze – Improve – Control | Define – Measure – Analyze – Design – Verify |
> | **Mindset** | Corrective | Preventive |
> | **Example** | Reduce billing errors in existing system | Design new digital claims platform |
>
> **Key Exam Idea:**
> DMAIC reacts to *variation*.
> DFSS (via DMADV) prevents it by **embedding quality in design**.

## 5  How DMADV Drives Innovation

- Begins with **strategic selection** — only projects linked to new markets or shifting customer expectations.  
- Converts the **Voice of the Customer** into **Voice of the Process** using CTQs.  
- Uses **multifunctional teams** (marketing, design, production, quality) from the start to avoid “over-the-wall” design errors.  
- Employs analytical tools like QFD, FMEA, and DOE for data-based design validation.  
- Ends with full pilot verification and transfer to operations.

## 6  Innovation as a System

The textbook distinguishes **two kinds of innovation**:

| **Type** | **Nature** | **Example** |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Type I** | Radical, entirely new invention | Electric light, airplane, nuclear power |
| **Type II** | Incremental / combinatorial | Smartphone (phone + music + internet) |

Type II innovation dominates modern design — DFSS formalizes this by encouraging teams to *make it bigger, smaller, or combine it* with something else.

> [!reflect] Insight  
> Innovation is not luck. It is repeatable when guided by **a structured design process** like DFSS.

> [!note] Key Takeaways  
> - DFSS = *Design for Six Sigma* → methodology for creating new products or processes.  
> - DMADV = *Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify* → the step-by-step framework that executes DFSS.  
> - Continuous Innovation combines Juran’s Quality by Design + DFSS → ensures organisations stay adaptive, customer-focused, and future-proof.
