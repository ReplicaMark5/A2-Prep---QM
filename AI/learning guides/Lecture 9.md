*Focus: Quality definitions, key thinkers, Juran Trilogy (orientation theory only)*

## 🧠 Core Idea
> **Quality Management** ensures an organisation consistently meets customer expectations by **planning**, **controlling**, and **improving** processes — even as everything changes.

## 🔺 Juran’s Trilogy (The Core Framework)


> [!tip] **Juran’s Trilogy — The Core Framework**
> Quality Management follows a three-part rhythm: **Plan → Control → Improve**
>
> | Stage | Purpose | Question to Ask | Example |
> | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
> | **Quality Planning** | Design processes that meet customer needs | “What do customers require and how do we deliver it?” | Designing a manufacturing line that meets safety specs |
> | **Quality Control** | Maintain standards by detecting and correcting issues | “Are we meeting the standard?” | Fixing a sudden production defect |
> | **Quality Improvement** | Eliminate chronic problems, raise performance | “How can we do better?” | Introducing Kaizen to reduce recurring waste |
>
> ✅ **Key takeaway:**  
> Planning builds the system → Control stabilises it → Improvement evolves it.


→ **Rhythm:** *Plan → Control → Improve*

- Globalisation & competition  
- Changing customer expectations  
- Market & social shifts  
- Resource scarcity  

### Internal Triggers

> “The only constant is change.”  
> Quality management responds to that change systematically.

- **Trade-off:** *Quality – Cost – Time → pick two*  
- **Poor quality** = lost income, rework costs, brand damage  
- **High quality** = customer loyalty, market longevity
