## 🧭 **1. Why Assess Quality Organisation-wide**

Assessment is the starting point of **continuous improvement**.  
It tells you where your organisation stands and what must change.

> [!important] **Purpose**
> - Understand the **baseline** of culture, systems, processes, people, and cost.  
> - Identify **gaps** and opportunities for improvement.  
> - Promote a **systems perspective**:
>   - Think about **internal + external customers**.  
>   - Avoid shifting problems instead of solving them.  
>   - Recognise the organisation as an **interconnected whole** — “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”

**Mnemonic:** *MAPS* → Measure → Assess → Plan → Sustain.

## 🧩 **2. Four Key Assessment Elements**

| Element | What It Evaluates | Why It Matters |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 💰 **Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ)** | Financial loss from poor performance | Shows how much quality problems cost. |
| 📊 **Standing in the Marketplace** | Competitive performance | Reveals strengths and threats. |
| 👥 **Employee Culture** | Attitudes, engagement, shared values | Determines if quality is truly lived. |
| ⚙️ **System Health** | Process maturity & efficiency | Shows how robust internal systems are. |

> [!tip] **Visual Cue**
> Picture a **dashboard** — each element is a gauge you monitor.  
> A drop in one affects the rest.

## 🛠️ **3. Planning the Assessment**

| Step | Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| **Define the Team** | Ensure cross-functional input. |
| **Set Objectives** | Clarify what success looks like. |
| **Scope & Criteria** | Focus efforts and avoid overlap. |
| **Communication Plan** | Keep leadership engaged. |
| **Pre-assessment** | Identify easy wins before full rollout. |

> [!important] **Principle**
> No clarity = no credibility.  
> A well-planned assessment earns buy-in and trust.

## 💰 **4. Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ)**

> [!summary] **Definition**
> Annual monetary loss caused by products and processes not meeting quality objectives.

### **Why Measure It**
- Quantifies the size of quality problems.
- Identifies cost-reduction opportunities.
- Tracks improvement over time.
- Supports strategic planning.

### **Categories of Quality Costs**

| Category | Description | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Prevention Costs** | Avoiding defects (training, design reviews). | Staff training |
| **Appraisal Costs** | Measuring conformance (testing, inspection). | Quality checks |
| **Internal Failure Costs** | Fixing defects before customer delivery. | Rework |
| **External Failure Costs** | Fixing issues after delivery. | Recalls, repairs |

**Hidden Costs:** Lost reputation, time, or opportunity.

> [!example] **Real-world COPQ Cases**
> - **Ford Pinto (1978):** 1.5M recalls after fatal fuel-tank defects.  
> - **Tylenol (1982):** 20M bottles recalled after tampering incident.  
> - **Firestone (2000):** 6.5M tires recalled — severe reputational damage.

## 🌍 **5. Standing in the Marketplace**

> [!quote] **Benchmarking Mindset**
> “You can’t be the best if you don’t know what the best looks like.”

- Provides a **snapshot** of performance vs competitors.  
- Identifies **opportunities and threats**.  
- Uses **market research**, awards, and benchmarking models.

### **Common Tools**
- Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award  
- ISO Standards  
- EFQM Excellence Model  
- FDA / Sarbanes–Oxley Compliance  
- Competitive Benchmarking

## ⚙️ **6. The Continuous Improvement Loop**

Assess → Analyse → Improve → Reassess


Assessment is a **habit**, not a one-time event.  
Each cycle strengthens the organisation’s maturity and resilience.

> [!example] Juran's Trilogy — Revision
>
> Revision from [[Quality Fundamentals & Juran Trilogy (Ch1)#🔺 Juran's Trilogy (The Core Framework)]]
>
> | Stage | Purpose | Key Question |
> |:--|:--|:--|
> | **Quality Planning** | Design to meet customer needs | "What do customers require?" |
> | **Quality Control** | Maintain performance | "Are we meeting the standard?" |
> | **Quality Improvement** | Eliminate chronic problems | "How can we do better?" |

---

> [!summary] **Final Takeaway**
> Organisation-wide quality assessment transforms invisible waste and weak culture into measurable data —  
> the foundation for **continuous improvement** and a **culture of quality**.
