Six Sigma is a customer-driven, data-driven approach for creating processes that deliver consistent, defect-free performance.

It contains three major components:

- A philosophy (reduce variation; focus on customer needs)
- A measurement system (sigma level, capability, defects)
- A set of methodologies (DMAIC and DFSS)
## Core Idea

Start with what the customer needs, translate it into measurable CTQs, and build or improve processes to meet those CTQs consistently.

Everything in Six Sigma revolves around:

- VOC (Voice of Customer) → What the customer values
- CTQs (Critical to Quality) → How those values become measurable requirements
- Variation reduction & capability → Ensuring reliable delivery of CTQs
# Two Major Methodologies in Six Sigma

Six Sigma splits into two branches, depending on whether a process exists or not:
## 1. DMAIC — Improve an Existing Process

Used when a process currently exists but is underperforming.
- Define: VOC, CTQs, problem definition
- Measure: Current performance; baseline sigma/capability
- Analyse: Find root causes
- Improve: Fix root causes; reduce variation
- Control: Sustain gains  

Goal: Make the existing process more capable, stable, and predictable.
## 2. DFSS — Design for Six Sigma (for NEW processes/products)

DFSS is the high-level concept focused on designing new processes, products, or services that inherently meet CTQs from the beginning.

DFSS is not a single rigid method — it is a design philosophy that can use multiple structured pathways.

The most common DFSS pathway is:
DMADV 

- Define: Customer needs and CTQs
- Measure: Translate VOC into measurable requirements
- Analyse: Develop and compare design concepts
- Design: Build the chosen design in detail
- Verify: Validate the design meets CTQs before launch  

DMADV is the primary methodology under DFSS.

Other DFSS variants exist (IDOV, DCCDI), but DMADV is the standard in most textbooks.
  

# How DFSS and DMAIC Fit Together

Think of them like this:

               SIX SIGMA

              /         \

        DMAIC           DFSS

     (improve)      (design new)

                      |

                    DMADV

              (most common DFSS path)

  

- DMAIC: Fix, stabilise, optimise existing processes.
- DFSS: Create new, capable processes from scratch.
- DMADV: The structured roadmap used inside DFSS.

# Role of VOC & CTQs Across Both  

VOC and CTQs always come first, regardless of methodology: 

- In DMAIC, they define what is wrong with the current process.
- In DFSS/DMADV, they shape what the new process must be built to deliver.

Both improvement and design activities anchor on CTQs because quality cannot be defined without customer requirements.

  

# Sigma Thinking (High-Level)

  

  

Six Sigma performance means:

  

- The process is centered on CTQs
- Variation is low
- Defects are extremely rare

  

  

It focuses on:

  

- Customer satisfaction
- Predictability and reliability
- Data-driven decisions

  

  

  

  

  

# Big Picture Summary

  

  

Six Sigma = Customer requirements (VOC → CTQs) + Data-driven methods (DMAIC or DFSS/DMADV) + Variation reduction → Reliable, high-quality processes.

  

  

- DMAIC improves existing processes.
- DFSS designs new processes.
- DMADV is the most common DFSS roadmap.
- All of it revolves around understanding and translating customer needs.
