### **FMECA / FMEA**

**Use when:** You need to identify and rank possible failure modes before they occur.  
**Purpose:** Prevent failures early, prioritise risks (Severity × Occurrence × Detection = RPN).  
**Best for:** Design reviews, process analysis, proactive reliability improvement.  
**Example:** Vehicle brake-pedal redesign at Toyota.  
**Key idea:** _Prevention before production._

---

### **HAZOPS**

**Use when:** Analysing **processes** for safety or operability deviations.  
**Purpose:** Find hazards (“What-if” scenarios) by applying guidewords like _No Flow_, _More Pressure_.  
**Best for:** Chemical, power, or manufacturing systems.  
**Key idea:** _Systematic team-based safety review._

---

### **DMAIC (Six Sigma)**

**Use when:** Improving an existing process.  
**Phases:** Define → Measure → Analyse → Improve → Control.  
**Best for:** Quality, variation, and defect-reduction projects.  
**Key idea:** _Continuous process improvement._

---

### **HALT (Highly Accelerated Life Testing)**

**Use when:** Testing prototypes in **design stage**.  
**Purpose:** Expose weak points via extreme thermal + vibration stress.  
**Outcome:** Reveal design limits fast, shorten development cycles.  
**Key idea:** _Break it early, fix it early._

---

### **CAD (Computer-Aided Design)**

**Use when:** Designing or simulating products/components.  
**Purpose:** Model geometry, materials, and tolerances before manufacture.  
**Key idea:** _Digital twin for design and analysis._

---

### **HASS (Highly Accelerated Stress Screening)**

**Use when:** Screening **production units** for hidden defects (after HALT).  
**Purpose:** Verify manufacturing consistency under controlled stress.  
**Key idea:** _Catch weak builds before shipping._

---

### **DOE (Design of Experiments)**

**Use when:** You must test multiple factors efficiently.  
**Purpose:** Quantify how inputs affect outputs; reveal interactions.  
**Best for:** Reliability optimisation, accelerated life testing, process tuning.  
**Key idea:** _Plan, vary, and measure scientifically._

---

### **QFD (Quality Function Deployment)**

**Use when:** Translating **customer needs (WHATs)** into **technical specs (HOWs)**.  
**Purpose:** Align design priorities with the Voice of Customer.  
**Key idea:** _Design quality in — not inspect it in._

---

### **SPC (Statistical Process Control)**

**Use when:** Monitoring production variation in real time.  
**Purpose:** Detect trends or out-of-control conditions using control charts.  
**Key idea:** _Stabilise the process._

---

### **FRACAS (Failure Reporting, Analysis & Corrective Action System)**

**Use when:** Tracking failures after deployment.  
**Purpose:** Record, analyse, and correct recurring issues.  
**Key idea:** _Closed-loop corrective action._

---

### **RCM (Reliability-Centred Maintenance)**

**Use when:** Developing a **maintenance strategy**.  
**Purpose:** Choose the most effective preventive/predictive maintenance for each asset.  
**Key idea:** _Right maintenance, right time._

---

### **NHPP (Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process)**

**Use when:** Modelling **time-dependent failure rates**.  
**Purpose:** Represent reliability growth or degradation over time.  
**Key idea:** _Failures not constant → use NHPP._

---

### **FTA (Fault Tree Analysis)**

**Use when:** Diagnosing **why** a top-level failure occurs.  
**Purpose:** Map logical combinations (AND/OR) of causes leading to system failure.  
**Best for:** Safety-critical or hierarchical systems.  
**Key idea:** _Top-down logic of failure._

---

### **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**

**Use when:** Comparing reliability metrics (e.g., MTBF) across ≥ 3 groups.  
**Purpose:** Determine if differences are statistically significant.  
**Best for:** Validating factor effects in DOE or supplier comparisons.  
**Key idea:** _Are group means truly different?_

---

**Revision tip:**  
Think **life-cycle linkage**  
→ _QFD → CAD → HALT → HASS → SPC → FMEA/FTA → RCM → FRACAS_

Each tool supports a different stage: design → test → production → maintenance → feedback.
