You’re absolutely right — QFD and CTQs are closely related and complementary in Six Sigma, especially in Design for Six Sigma (DFSS). They are not the same, but QFD is often the method used to identify and prioritize CTQs.

Let’s break it down clearly:

  

QFD vs. CTQs: Comparison

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Aspect|QFD (Quality Function Deployment)|CTQ (Critical to Quality)|
|Definition|A method/tool to translate customer needs into technical requirements.|A measurable characteristic of a product/process that is critical to customer satisfaction.|
|Purpose|Discover and structure what matters to the customer → link to design specs.|Define the key outputs that must be controlled to meet customer expectations.|
|Output|A House of Quality matrix showing relationships, priorities, and targets.|A list of specific, measurable requirements (e.g., “Print speed ≥ 30 ppm”).|
|Role in Process|Input → Process → Output (systematic translation).|Output of QFD (the “HOWs” become CTQs).|
|Example|Customer says: “Fast printing” → QFD links to → CTQ: Print speed ≥ 30 ppm|CTQ: First-page-out time ≤ 8 seconds|

  

How They Work Together (in DFSS / DMADV)

QFD is the tool → CTQs are the result




Real-World Example

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Customer Need (VOC)|QFD Process|Resulting CTQ|
|“Printer should be quiet”|QFD links to noise level (dB)|CTQ: Operating noise ≤ 48 dB|
|“Easy to set up”|QFD links to setup steps|CTQ: Setup time ≤ 5 minutes|

  

Key Insight:

QFD answers:  
“What does the customer really want, and how do we design it?”

CTQs answer:  
“What must we measure and control to deliver that?”

  

Summary

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Concept|Role|
|QFD|Method to systematically convert customer needs → technical specs|
|CTQ|Outcome — the critical, measurable requirements that come from QFD|

QFD → generates → CTQs  
They are linked, not the same  
Used together in DFSS (DMADV) to “design quality in”

Bottom line:

QFD is the how — CTQ is the what.  
You use QFD to discover and define your CTQs.
